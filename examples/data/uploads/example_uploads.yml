    title: Electronic structure code input and output files
    description: |
      This upload demonstrate the basic use of NOMAD's *parsers*. For many *electronic
      structure codes* (VASP, etc.), NOMAD provides parsers. You simply upload
      the *input and output files* of your simulations and NOMAD parsers are extracting
      all necessary metadata to produce a **FAIR** dataset.
  eln:
    path: examples/data/uploads/eln.zip
    title: Electronic Lab Notebook
    description: |
      This example contains a custom NOMAD *schema* to create an **Electronic
      Lab Notebook (ELN)** and a few example *data* entries that use this schema.
      The schema demonstrates the basic concepts behind a NOMAD ELN and can be a good
      **starting point** to create you own schemas that model **FAIR data** acquired in your lab.
  tables:
    path: examples/data/uploads/tabular.zip
    title: Tabular Data
    description: |
      This upload demonstrates the used of tabular data. In this example we use an *xlsx*
      file in combination with a custom schema. The schema describes what the columns
      in the excel file mean and NOMAD can parse everything accordingly to
      produce a **FAIR** dataset.

    title: Tailored Research Data Management (RDM) with NOMAD
    description: |
      This notebook will teach you how you can build tailored research data
      management (RDM) solutions using NOMAD. It uses existing thermally
      activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecule data to teach you how we
      can use the NOMAD to turn research data into datasets that are FAIR:
      Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The end-result can be
      distributed as a NOMAD plugin: a self-contained Python package that can be
      installed on a NOMAD Oasis.

    title: NOMAD as a Data Management Framework Tutorial
    description: |
      This upload provides a notebook as a tutorial that demonstrates how to use NOMAD
      for managing custom data and file types. Based on a simple *Countries of the World*
      dataset, it shows how to model the data in a schema, do parsing and normalization,
      process data, access existing data with NOMAD's API for analysis, and how to
      add visualization to your data.
FAIRmat examples:
  ellips:
    path: examples/data/uploads/ellips.zip
    title: Ellipsometry
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize ellipsometry data.
      It shows the generation of a NeXus file according to the [NXellipsometry](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/NXellipsometry.html#nxellipsometry)
      application definition and a successive analysis of a SiO2 on Si Psi/Delta measurement.
  mpes:
    path: examples/data/uploads/mpes.zip
    title: Mpes
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize multi photoemission spectroscopy (MPES) experimental data. It contains three major examples:

        - Taking a pre-binned file, here stored in a h5 file, and converting it into the standardized MPES NeXus format.
          There exists a [NeXus application definition for MPES](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/NXmpes.html#nxmpes) which details the internal structure of such a file.
        - Binning of raw data (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00769-8) for additional resources) into a h5 file and consecutively generating a NeXus file from it.
        - An analysis example using data in the NeXus format and employing the [pyARPES](https://github.com/chstan/arpes) analysis tool to reproduce the main findings of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07158.pdf).
  xps:
    path: examples/data/uploads/xps.zip
    title: XPS
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize XPS data.
      It shows the generation of a NeXus file according to the
      [NXmpes](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/NXmpes.html#nxmpes)
      application definition and a successive analysis of an example data set.
  sts:
    path: examples/data/uploads/sts.zip
    title: STS
    description: |
      This example is for two types of experiments: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) from Scanning Probe Microscopy.
      It can transform the data from files generated by a the nanonis software into the NeXus application definition NXsts.
      The example contains data files from the two specific nanonis software versions generic 5e and generic 4.5.

    title: Atom Probe Microscopy
    description: |
      This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to store and standardize atom probe data.
      It shows the generation of a NeXus file according to the

      application definition and a successive analysis of an example data set.
      The example contains a small atom probe dataset from an experiment with a LEAP instrument to get you started
      and keep the size of your NOMAD installation small. Ones started, we recommend to change the respective
      input file in the NOMAD Oasis ELN to run the example with your own datasets.
